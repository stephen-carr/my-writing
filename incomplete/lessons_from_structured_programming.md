# A lesson from structured programming.

Being programmers with very small heads, we must utilise tools in order to combat the potential complexity of procedures and the classes of computations which they envoke. These three tools (in no particular order) are:

  1) Mathematical Induction;
  2) Enumeration;
  3) Abstraction.

The enemy of the programmer's efforts is complexity, i.e. the byproduct of our attempts to build more powerful computations. It is the enemy for it introduces a great terror through randomness, through the inabilty to reason. Systems which require great mental efforts to squeeze through (and even then not always unscathed) are very impractical systems.

The art of programming, far from being some esoteric ideal, is really about the design of programs--programs which never attempt to battle complexity head on. Good program design cuts the beast apart at the base, it never gives complexity a chance to grow. The art of programming is about dealing with the set of problems which a human may hold within their intellectual grips. This, as opposed to bringing down what we can do, will raise the human mind to greater heights of reasoning.

If mathematics is the science of effective reasoning, and programming is a branch of mathematics, then we, as programmers, have no doubts where our energies should be spent.
